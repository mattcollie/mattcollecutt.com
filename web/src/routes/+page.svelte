        Hi, I’m Matt! I’m passionate about a lot of things. Here you’ll find observations
        I’ve made about different topics with a focus around software development.

        The main reason for starting this blog is to improve my written communication skills,
        it’s always been somewhat of a struggle. I hope you’ll enjoy what I have to offer in
        the form of blog posts and that you’ll leave having learnt something new.
    </p>

        I’m still exploring the direction I want to take this website, so the content may evolve
        over time. I’ve love to hear your thoughts and feedback as I continue to develop the site,
        so feel free to leave a comment or get in touch.
    </p>
