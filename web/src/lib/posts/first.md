My first blog post, it's been a long time coming. I've wanted to start a 
blog since I started my professional career but never really got around 
to it. Now is a good of time as any I suppose.


One of my goals for this blog is that my writing skills will improve.
I've always got a lot to say, so I can sometimes struggle to put it into words,
So here's the opportunity to improve!


I expect to write about my professional life as a software developer, any
challenges that I face throughout my day and any solutions that I come across.
In the hopes that if anyone else has found themselves in the same situation,
one of these posts will make their lives a bit easier.


We'll see how this ends up. If you can relate to my situation then I you
can find solace in the face that you're not alone! Enjoy.
